---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #253: benchmark script's new --timeout option.
 * #270: new -V / --verbose cmdline option to enable a more verbose logging.

BUG FIXES

 * #254: bench.py script hadn't been ported to Python 3.
 * #263: MultiprocessFTPServer leaks memory and file descriptors.  (patch by
         Juan J. Martinez)

Version: 1.2.0 - Date: 2013-04-22
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #250: added FTPServer's backlog argument controlling the queue of accepted
        connections.
 * #251: IOLoop.fileno() method for epoll() and kqueue() pollers.
 * #252: FTPServer 'address' parameter can also be an existent socket object.

BUG FIXES

 * #245: ThreadedFTPServer hogs all CPU resources after a client connects.


Version: 1.1.0 - Date: 2013-04-09
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #240: enabled "python -m pyftpdlib" cmdline syntax and got rid of
         "python -m pyftpdlib.ftpserver" syntax which was deprecated in 1.0.0.
 * #241: empty passwords are now allowed for anonymous and other users.
 * #244: pysendfile is no longer a dependency if we're on Python >= 3.3 as
         os.sendfile() will be used instead.
 * #247: on python 3.3 use time.monotonic() instead of time.time() so that the
         scheduler won't break in case of system clock updates.
 * #248: bench.py memory usage is highly overestimated.

BUG FIXES

 * #238: username is not logged in case of failed authentication.
         (patch by tlockert)

         bind() is already in use.
 * #245: ThreadedFTPServer hogs all CPU resources after a client connects.
 * #246: ThrottledDTPHandler was broken.

INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGES

 * "python -m pyftpdlib.ftpserver" cmdline syntax doesn't work anymore


Version: 1.0.1 - Date: 2013-02-22
---------------------------------

BUG FIXES

 * #236: MultiprocessFTPServer and ThreadedFTPServer hanging in case of failed
         authentication.


Version: 1.0.0 - Date: 2013-02-19
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #76:  python 3.x porting.
 * #198: full unicode support (RFC-2640).
 * #203: asyncore IO loop has been rewritten from scratch and now supports
         epoll() on Linux and kqueue() on OSX/BSD.
         Also select() (Windows) and poll() pollers have been rewritten
         resulting in pyftpdlib being an order of magnitude faster and more
         scalable than ever.
 * #204: a new FilesystemError exception class is available in order send
         custom error strings to client from an AbstracteFS subclass.
 * #207: added on_connect() and on_disconnect() callback methods to FTPHandler
         class.
 * Issues 212: provided two new classes:
           - pyftpdlib.servers.ThreadedFTPServer
           - pyftpdlib.servers.MultiprocessFTPServer  (POSIX only)
         They can be used to change the base async-based concurrecy model and
         use a multiple threads / processes based approach instead.
         Your FTPHandler subclasses will finally be free to block! ;)
 * #219: it is not possible to instantiate different FPTS classes using
         different SSL certificates.
 * #213: DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() has changed in that it
         no longer returns a bool but instead raises AuthenticationFailed()
         exception to signal a failed authentication.
         This has been done in order allow customized error messages on failed
         auth. Also it now expects a third 'handler' argument which is passed in
         order to allow IP-based authentication logic. Existing code overriding
         validate_authentication() must be changed in accordance.
 * #223: ftpserver.py has been split in submodules.
 * #225: logging module is now used for logging. ftpserver.py's log(), logline()
         and logerror() functions are deprecated.
 * #231: FTPHandler.ftp_* methods implementing filesystem-related commands
         now return a meaningful value on success (tipically the path name).
 * #234: FTPHandler and DTPHandler class provide a nice __repr__.
 * #235: FTPServer.serve_forever() has a new handle_exit parameter which
         can be set to False in order to avoid handling SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
         and logging server start and stop.
 * #236: big logging refactoring; by default only useful messages are logged
         (as opposed to *all* commands and responses exchanged by client and
         server).  Also, FTPHandler has a new 'log_prefix' attribute which can
         be used to format every line logged.

BUG FIXES

 * #131: IPv6 dual-stack support was broken.
 * #206: can't change directory (CWD) when using UnixAuthorizer and process
         cwd is == "/root".
 * #211: pyftpdlib doesn't work if deprecated py-sendfile 1.2.4 module is
         installed.
 * #215: usage of FTPHandler.sleeping attribute could lead to 100% CPU usage.
         FTPHandler.sleeping is now removed. self.add_channel() /
         self.del_channel() should be used instead.
 * #222: an unhandled exception in handle_error() or close() can cause server
         to crash.
 * #229: backslashes on UNIX are not handled properly.
 * #232: hybrid IPv4/IPv6 support is broken.  (patch by Claus Klein)

NEW MODULES

All the code contained in pyftpdlib/ftpserver.py and pyftpdlib/contrib
namespaces has been moved here:

 * pyftpdlib.authorizers
 * pyftpdlib.filesystems
 * pyftpdlib.servers
 * pyftpdlib.handlers
 * pyftpdlib.log

NEW APIS

 * pyftpdlib.authorizers.AuthenticationFailed
 * pyftpdlib.filesystems.FilesystemError
 * pyftpdlib.servers.ThreadedFTPServer
 * pyftpdlib.servers.MultiprocessFTPServer
 * pyftpdlib.handlers.FTPHandler's on_connect() and on_disconnect() callbacks.
 * pyftpdlib.handlers.FTPHandler.ftp_* methods return a meaningful value on
         success.
 * FTPServer, FTPHandler, DTPHandler new ioloop attribute.
 * pyftpdlib.lib.ioloop.IOLoop class (not supposed to be used directly)
 * pyftpdlib.handlers.FTPHandler.log_prefix

DEPRECATED NAME SPACES

 * pyftpdlib.ftpserver
 * pyftpdlib.contrib.*

INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGES

 * All the main classes have been extracted from ftpserver.py and split into sub
   modules.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BEFORE                              | NOW
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  pyftpdlib.ftpserver.FTPServer       | pyftpdlib.servers.FTPServer

  pyftpdlib.ftpserver.AbstractedFS    | pyftpdlib.filesystems.AbstractedFS
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Same for pyftpflib.contribs namespace which is deprecated.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BEFORE                                          | NOW
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  pyftpdlib.contrib.filesystems.UnixFilesystem    | pyftpdlib.filesystems.UnixFilesystem
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Both imports from pyftpdlib.ftpserver and pyftpdlib.contrib.* will still work
  though and will raise a DeprecationWarning exception.

 * DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() signature has changed. A third
   'handler' argument is now expected.

 * DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() is no longer expected to return a
   bool. Instead it is supposed to raise AuthenticationFailed(msg) in case of
   failed authentication and return None otherwise.
   (see issue 213)

 * ftpserver.py's log(), logline() and logerror() functions are deprecated.
   logging module is now used instead. See:
   http://code.google.com/p/billiejoex/wiki/Tutorial#4.2_-_Logging_management

 * Unicode is now used instead of bytes pretty much everywhere.

 * FTPHandler.__init__() and TLS_FTPHandler.__init__() signatures have changed:
   - __init__(conn, server)
   + __init__(conn, server, ioloop=None)

 * FTPServer.server_forever() signature has changed:
   - serve_forever(timeout=1.0, use_poll=False, count=None)
   + serve_forever(timeout=1.0, blocking=True, handle_exit=True)

 * FTPServer.close_all() signature has changed:
   - close_all(ignore_all=False)
   + close_all()

 * FTPServer.serve_forever() and FTPServer.close_all() are no longer class
   methods.

 * asyncore.dispatcher and asynchat.async_chat classes has been replaced by:
   - pyftpdlib.ioloop.Acceptor
   - pyftpdlib.ioloop.Connector
   - pyftpdlib.ioloop.AsyncChat
   Any customization relying on asyncore (e.g. use of asyncore.socket_map to
   figure out the number of connected clients) will no longer work.

 * pyftpdlib.ftpserver.CallLater and pyftpdlib.ftpserver.CallEvery are
   deprecated. Instead, use self.ioloop.call_later() and self.ioloop.call_every()
   from within the FTPHandler.  Also delay() method of the returned object has
   been removed.

 * FTPHandler.sleeping attribute is removed. self.add_channel() and
   self.del_channel() should be used to pause and restart the handler.

MINOR INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGES

 - FTPHandler.respond(resp)
 + FTPHandler.respond(resp, logfun=logger.debug)

 - FTPHandler.log(resp)
 + FTPHandler.log(resp, logfun=logger.info)

 - FTPHandler.logline(resp)
 + FTPHandler.logline(resp, logfun=logger.debug)


Version: 0.7.0 - Date: 2012-01-25
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #152: uploads (from server to client) on UNIX are now from 2x (Linux) to 3x
         (OSX) faster because of sendfile(2) system call usage.
 * #155: AbstractedFS "root" and "cwd" are no longer read-only properties but
         can be set via setattr().
 * #168: added FTPHandler.logerror() method. It can be overridden to provide
         more information (e.g. username) when logging exception tracebacks.
 * #174: added support for SITE CHMOD command (change file mode).
 * #177: setuptools is now used in setup.py
 * #178: added anti flood script in demo directory.
 * #181: added CallEvery class to call a function every x seconds.
 * #185: pass Debian licenscheck tool.
 * #189: the internal scheduler has been rewritten from scratch and it is an
         order of magnitude faster, especially for operations like cancel()
         which are involved when clients are disconnected (hence invoked very
         often). Some benchmarks:
           - schedule         : +0.5x
           - reschedule : +1.7x
           - cancel           : +477x  (with 1 milion scheduled functions)
           - run:                   : +8x
         Also, a single scheduled function now consumes 1/3 of the memory thanks
         to __slots__ usage.
 * #195: enhanced unix_daemon.py script which (now uses python-daemon library).
 * #196: added callback for failed login attempt.
 * #200: FTPServer.server_forever() is now a class method.
 * #202: added benchmark script.

BUG FIXES

 * #156: data connection must be closed before sending 226/426 reply. This was
         against RFC-959 and was causing problems with older FTP clients.
 * #161: MLSD 'unique' fact can provide the same value for files having a
         similar device/inode but that in fact are different.
         (patch by Andrew Scheller)
 * #162: (FTPS) SSL shutdown() is not invoked for the control connection.
 * #163: FEAT erroneously reports MLSD. (patch by Andrew Scheller)
 * #166: (FTPS) an exception on send() can cause server to crash (DoS).
 * #167: fix some typos returned on HELP.
 * #170: PBSZ and PROT commands are now allowed before authentication fixing
         problems with non-compliant FTPS clients.
 * #171: (FTPS) an exception when shutting down the SSL layer can cause server
         to crash (DoS).
 * #173: file last modification time shown in LIST response might be in a
         language different than English causing problems with some clients.
 * #175: FEAT response now omits to show those commands which are removed from
         proto_cmds map.
 * #176: SO_REUSEADDR option is now used for passive data sockets to prevent
         server running out of free ports when using passive_ports directive.
 * #187: match proftpd LIST format for files having last modification time
         > 6 months.
 * #188: fix maximum recursion depth exceeded exception occurring if client
         quickly connects and disconnects data channel.
 * #191: (FTPS) during SSL shutdown() operation the server can end up in an
         infinite loop hogging CPU resources.
 * #199: UnixAuthorizer with require_valid_shell option is broken.

MAJOR API CHANGES SINCE 0.6.0:

 * New FTPHandler.use_sendfile attribute.
 * sendfile() is now automatically used instead of plain send() if
   pysendfile module is installed.
 * FTPServer.serve_forever() is a classmethod.
 * AbstractedFS root and cwd properties can now be set via setattr().
 * New CallLater class.
 * New FTPHandler.on_login_failed(username, password) method.
 * New FTPHandler.logerror(msg) method.
 * New FTPHandler.log_exception(instance) method.


Version: 0.6.0 - Date: 2011-01-24
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #68:  added full FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) support provided by new
         TLS_FTPHandler class defined in pyftpdlib.contrib.handlers module.
 * #86:  pyftpdlib now reports all ls and MDTM timestamps as GMT times, as
         recommended in RFC-3659.  A FTPHandler.use_gmt_times attributed has
         been added and can be set to False in case local times are desired
         instead.
 * #124: pyftpdlib now accepts command line options to configure a stand alone
         anonymous FTP server when running pyftpdlib with python's -m option.
 * #125: logs are now provided in a standardized format parsable by log
         analyzers. FTPHandler class provides two new methods to standardize
         both commands and transfers logging: log_cmd() and log_transfer().
 * #127: added FTPHandler.masquerade_address_map option which allows you to
         define multiple 1 to 1 mappings in case you run a FTP server with
         multiple private IP addresses behind a NAT firewall with multiple
         public IP addresses.
 * #128: files and directories owner and group names and os.readlink are now
         resolved via AbstractedFS methods instead of in format_list().
 * #129:
   #139: added 4 new callbacks to FTPHandler class:
         on_incomplete_file_sent(), on_incomplete_file_received(), on_login()
         and on_logout().
 * #130: added UnixAuthorizer and WindowsAuthorizer classes defined in the new
         pyftpdlib.contrib.authorizers module.
 * #131: pyftpdlib is now able to serve both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time by
         using a single socket.
 * #133: AbstractedFS constructor now accepts two argumets: root and cmd_channel
         breaking compatibility with previous version.  Also, root and and cwd
         attributes became properties.  The previous bug consisting in resetting
         the root from the ftp handler after user login has been fixed to ease
         the development of subclasses.
 * #134: enabled TCP_NODELAY socket option for the FTP command channels
         resulting in pyftpdlib being twice faster.
 * #135: Python 2.3 support has been dropped.
 * #137: added new pyftpdlib.contrib.filesystems module within
         UnixFilesystem class which permits the client to escape its home
         directory and navigate the real filesystem.
 * #138: added DTPHandler.get_elapsed_time() method which returns the transfer
         elapsed time in seconds.
 * #144: a "username" parameter is now passed to authorizer's
         terminate_impersonation() method.
 * #149: ftpserver.proto_cmds dictionary refactoring and get rid of
         _CommandProperty class.

BUG FIXES

 * #120: an ActiveDTP() instance is not garbage collected in case a client
         issuing PORT disconnects before establishing the data connection.
 * #122: a wrong variable name was used in AbstractedFS.validpath method.
 * #123: PORT command doesn't bind to correct address in case an alias is
         created for the local network interface.
 * #140: pathnames returned in PWD response should have double-quotes '"'
         escaped.
 * #143: EINVAL not properly handled causes server crash on OSX.
 * #146: SIZE and MDTM commands are now rejected unless the "l" permission has
         been specified for the user.
 * #150: path traversal bug: it is possible to move/rename a file outside of the
         user home directory.

MAJOR API CHANGES SINCE 0.5.2

 * dropped Python 2.3 support.
 * all classes are now new-style classes.
 * AbstractedFS class:
     * __init__ now accepts two arguments: root and cmd_channel.
     * root and cwd attributes are now read-only properties.
     * 3 new methods have been added:
       - get_user_by_uid()
       - get_group_by_gid()
       - readlink()
 * FTPHandler class:
     * new class attributes:
       - use_gmt_times
       - tcp_no_delay
       - masquerade_address_map
     * new methods:
       - on_incomplete_file_sent()
       - on_incomplete_file_received()
       - on_login()
       - on_logout()
       - log_cmd()
       - log_transfer()
     * proto_cmds class attribute has been added.  The FTPHandler class no
       longer relies on "ftpserver.proto_cmds" global dictionary but on
       "ftpserver.FTPHandler.proto_cmds" instead.
 * FTPServer class:
     - max_cons attribute defaults to 512 by default instead of 0 (unlimited).
     - server_forever()'s map argument is gone.
 * DummyAuthorizer:
     - ValueError exceptions are now raised instead of AuthorizerError.
     - terminate_impersonation() method now expects a "username" parameter.
 * DTPHandler.get_elapsed_time() method has been added.
 * Added a new package in pyftpdlib namespace: "contrib". Modules (and classes)
   defined here:
     - pyftpdlib.contrib.handlers.py (TLS_FTPHandler)
     - pyftpdlib.contrib.authorizers.py (UnixAuthorizer, WindowsAuthorizer)
     - pyftpdlib.contrib.filesystems (UnixFilesystem)

MINOR API CHANGES SINCE 0.5.2

 * FTPHandler renamed objects:
     - data_server -> _dtp_acceptor
     - current_type -> _current_type
     - restart_position -> _restart_position
     - quit_pending -> _quit_pending
     - af -> _af
     - on_dtp_connection -> _on_dtp_connection
     - on_dtp_close -> _on_dtp_close
     - idler -> _idler
 * AbstractedFS.rnfr attribute moved to FTPHandler._rnfr.


Version: 0.5.2 - Date: 2009-09-14
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #103: added unix_daemon.py script.
 * #108: a new ThrottledDTPHandler class has been added for limiting the speed
         of downloads and uploads.

BUG FIXES

 * #100: fixed a race condition in FTPHandler constructor which could throw an
         exception in case of connection bashing (DoS).  (thanks Bram Neijt)
 * #102: FTPServer.close_all() now removes any unfired delayed call left behind
         to prevent potential memory leaks.
 * #104: fixed a bug in FTPServer.handle_accept() where socket.accept() could
         return None instead of a valid address causing the server to crash.
         (OS X only, reported by Wentao Han)
 * #104: an unhandled EPIPE exception might be thrown by asyncore.recv() when
         dealing with ill-behaved clients on OS X . (reported by Wentao Han)
 * #105: ECONNABORTED might be thrown by socket.accept() on FreeBSD causing the
         server to crash.
 * #109: an unhandled EBADF exception might be thrown when using poll() on OSX
         and FreeBSD.
 * #111: the license used was not MIT as stated in source files.
 * #112: fixed a MDTM related test case failure occurring on 64 bit OSes.
 * #113: fixed unix_ftp.py which was treating anonymous as a normal user.
 * #114: MLST is now denied unless the "l" permission has been specified for the
         user.
 * #115: asyncore.dispatcher.close() is now called before doing any other
         cleanup operation when client disconnects. This way we avoid an endless
         loop which hangs the server in case an exception is raised in close()
         method. (thanks Arkadiusz Wahlig)
 * #116: extra carriage returns were added to files transferred in ASCII mode.
 * #118: CDUP always changes to "/".
 * #119: QUIT sent during a transfer caused a memory leak.


API CHANGES SINCE 0.5.1:

 * ThrottledDTPHandler class has been added.
 * FTPHandler.process_command() method has been added.


Version: 0.5.1 - Date: 2009-01-21
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #79: added two new callback methods to FTPHandler class to handle
        "on_file_sent" and "on_file_received" events.
 * #82: added table of contents in documentation.
 * #92: ASCII transfers are now 200% faster on those systems using "\r\n" as
        line separator (typically Windows).
 * #94: a bigger buffer size for send() and recv() has been set resulting in a
        considerable speedup (about 40% faster) for both incoming and outgoing
        data transfers.
 * #98: added preliminary support for SITE command.
 * #99: a new script implementing FTPS (FTP over TLS/SSL) has been added to the
        demo directory. See:
        http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/trunk/demo/tls_ftpd.py

BUG FIXES

 * #78: the idle timeout of passive data connections gets stopped in case of
        rejected "site-to-site" connections.
 * #80: demo/md5_ftpd.py should use hashlib module instead of the deprecated md5
        module.
 * #81: fixed some tests which were failing on SunOS.
 * #84: fixed a very rare unhandled exception which could occur when retrieving
        the first bytes of a corrupted file.
 * #85: a positive MKD response is supposed to include the name of the new
        directory.
 * #87: SIZE should be rejected when the current TYPE is ASCII.
 * #88: REST should be rejected when the current TYPE is ASCII.
 * #89: "TYPE AN" was erroneously treated as synonym for "TYPE A" when "TYPE L7"
        should have been used instead.
 * #90: an unhandled exception can occur when using MDTM against a file modified
        before year 1900.
 * #91: an unhandled exception can occur in case accept() returns None instead
        of a socket (it happens sometimes).
 * #95: anonymous is now treated as any other case-sensitive user.

API CHANGES SINCE 0.5.0:

 * FTPHandler gained a new "_extra_feats" private attribute.
 * FTPHandler gained two new methods: "on_file_sent" and "on_file_received".


Version: 0.5.0 - Date: 2008-09-20
---------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS

 * #72: pyftpdlib now provides configurable idle timeouts to disconnect client
        after a long time of inactivity.
 * #73: imposed a delay before replying for invalid credentials to minimize the
        risk of brute force password guessing (RFC-1123).
 * #74: it is now possible to define permission exceptions for certain
        directories (e.g. creating a user which does not have write permission
        except for one sub-directory in FTP root).
 * #    Improved bandwidth throttling capabilities of demo/throttled_ftpd.py
        script  by having used the new CallLater class which drastically reduces
        the number of time.time() calls.

BUG FIXES
