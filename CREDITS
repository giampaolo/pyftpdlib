
Intro
=====

I would like to recognize some of the people who have been 
instrumental in the development of pyftpdlib. 
I'm sure I am  forgetting some people (feel free to email 
me), but here is a short list.
It's modeled after the Linux CREDITS file where the fields
are:
name (N), e-mail (E), web-address (W), description (D).
Really thanks to all of you.
