Version: 1.0.1 - Date: 2013-02-22
=================================

**Bug fixes**

- #236: MultiprocessFTPServer and ThreadedFTPServer hanging in case of failed
  authentication.


Version: 1.0.0 - Date: 2013-02-19
=================================

**Enhancements**

- #76: python 3.x porting.
- #198: full unicode support (RFC-2640).
- #203: asyncore IO loop has been rewritten from scratch and now supports
  epoll() on Linux and kqueue() on OSX/BSD.
  Also select() (Windows) and poll() pollers have been rewritten
  resulting in pyftpdlib being an order of magnitude faster and more
  scalable than ever.

  Logging_managementpyftpdlib.servers.ThreadedFTPServer and
  pyftpdlib.servers.MultiprocessFTPServer (POSIX only).
  They can be used to change the base async-based concurrecy model and
  use a multiple threads / processes based approach instead.
  Your FTPHandler subclasses will finally be free to block! ;)
- #219: it is not possible to instantiate different FPTS classes using
  different SSL certificates.
- #213: DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() has changed in that it
  no longer returns a bool but instead raises AuthenticationFailed()
  exception to signal a failed authentication.
  This has been done in order allow customized error messages on failed
  auth. Also it now expects a third 'handler' argument which is passed in
  order to allow IP-based authentication logic. Existing code overriding
  validate_authentication() must be changed in accordance.
- #223: ftpserver.py has been split in submodules.
- #225: logging module is now used for logging. ftpserver.py's log(), logline()
  and logerror() functions are deprecated.

  now return a meaningful value on success (tipically the path name).
- #234: FTPHandler and DTPHandler class provide a nice __repr__.
- #235: FTPServer.serve_forever() has a new handle_exit parameter which
  can be set to False in order to avoid handling SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
  and logging server start and stop.
- #236: big logging refactoring; by default only useful messages are logged
  (as opposed to *all* commands and responses exchanged by client and
  server).  Also, FTPHandler has a new 'log_prefix' attribute which can
  be used to format every line logged.

**Bug fixes**

- #131: IPv6 dual-stack support was broken.
- #206: can't change directory (CWD) when using UnixAuthorizer and process
  cwd is == "/root".
- #211: pyftpdlib doesn't work if deprecated py-sendfile 1.2.4 module is
  installed.
- #215: usage of FTPHandler.sleeping attribute could lead to 100% CPU usage.
  FTPHandler.sleeping is now removed. self.add_channel() /
  self.del_channel() should be used instead.
- #222: an unhandled exception in handle_error() or close() can cause server
  to crash.
- #229: backslashes on UNIX are not handled properly.
- #232: hybrid IPv4/IPv6 support is broken.  (patch by Claus Klein)

namespaces has been moved here:

- pyftpdlib.authorizers
- pyftpdlib.filesystems
- pyftpdlib.servers
- pyftpdlib.handlers

  success.
- FTPServer, FTPHandler, DTPHandler new ioloop attribute.
- pyftpdlib.lib.ioloop.IOLoop class (not supposed to be used directly)
- pyftpdlib.handlers.FTPHandler.log_prefix

  +-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

  Both imports from pyftpdlib.ftpserver and pyftpdlib.contrib.* will still work
  though and will raise a DeprecationWarning exception.

**Other incompatible API changes**

- DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() signature has changed. A third
  'handler' argument is now expected.
- DummyAuthorizer.validate_authentication() is no longer expected to return a
  bool. Instead it is supposed to raise AuthenticationFailed(msg) in case of
  failed authentication and return None otherwise.
  (see issue 213)
- ftpserver.py's log(), logline() and logerror() functions are deprecated.
  logging module is now used instead. See:
  http://code.google.com/p/billiejoex/wiki/Tutorial#4.2_-_Logging_management
- Unicode is now used instead of bytes pretty much everywhere.
- FTPHandler.__init__() and TLS_FTPHandler.__init__() signatures have changed:
  from __init__(conn, server)
  to   __init__(conn, server, ioloop=None)
- FTPServer.server_forever() signature has changed:
  from serve_forever(timeout=1.0, use_poll=False, count=None)
  to   serve_forever(timeout=1.0, blocking=True, handle_exit=True)
- FTPServer.close_all() signature has changed:
  from close_all(ignore_all=False)
  to   close_all()
- FTPServer.serve_forever() and FTPServer.close_all() are no longer class
  methods.
- asyncore.dispatcher and asynchat.async_chat classes has been replaced by:
  pyftpdlib.ioloop.Acceptor
  pyftpdlib.ioloop.Connector
  pyftpdlib.ioloop.AsyncChat
  Any customization relying on asyncore (e.g. use of asyncore.socket_map to
  figure out the number of connected clients) will no longer work.
- pyftpdlib.ftpserver.CallLater and pyftpdlib.ftpserver.CallEvery are
  deprecated. Instead, use self.ioloop.call_later() and self.ioloop.call_every()
  from within the FTPHandler.  Also delay() method of the returned object has
  been removed.
- FTPHandler.sleeping attribute is removed. self.add_channel() and
  self.del_channel() should be used to pause and restart the handler.

**Minor incompatible API changes**

- FTPHandler.respond(resp) -> FTPHandler.respond(resp, logfun=logger.debug)
- FTPHandler.log(resp)     -> FTPHandler.log(resp, logfun=logger.info)
- FTPHandler.logline(resp) -> FTPHandler.logline(resp, logfun=logger.debug)

  (OSX) faster because of sendfile(2) system call usage.
- #155: AbstractedFS "root" and "cwd" are no longer read-only properties but
  can be set via setattr().

- #178: added anti flood script in demo directory.
- #181: added CallEvery class to call a function every x seconds.
- #185: pass Debian licenscheck tool.
- #189: the internal scheduler has been rewritten from scratch and it is an
  order of magnitude faster, especially for operations like cancel()
  which are involved when clients are disconnected (hence invoked very
  often). Some benchmarks:
  schedule:   +0.5x,
  reschedule: +1.7x,
  cancel:     +477x (with 1 million scheduled functions),
  run: +8x
  Also, a single scheduled function now consumes 1/3 of the memory thanks
  to ``__slots__`` usage.
- #195: enhanced unix_daemon.py script which (now uses python-daemon library).
- #196: added callback for failed login attempt.
- #200: FTPServer.server_forever() is now a class method.
- #202: added benchmark script.

**Bug fixes**

- #166: (FTPS) an exception on send() can cause server to crash (DoS).
- #167: fix some typos returned on HELP.
- #170: PBSZ and PROT commands are now allowed before authentication fixing
  problems with non-compliant FTPS clients.
- #171: (FTPS) an exception when shutting down the SSL layer can cause server
  to crash (DoS).
- #173: file last modification time shown in LIST response might be in a
  language different than English causing problems with some clients.
- #175: FEAT response now omits to show those commands which are removed from
  proto_cmds map.
- #176: SO_REUSEADDR option is now used for passive data sockets to prevent
  server running out of free ports when using passive_ports directive.
- #187: match proftpd LIST format for files having last modification time
  > 6 months.
- #188: fix maximum recursion depth exceeded exception occurring if client
  quickly connects and disconnects data channel.
- #191: (FTPS) during SSL shutdown() operation the server can end up in an
  infinite loop hogging CPU resources.
- #199: UnixAuthorizer with require_valid_shell option is broken.

  been added and can be set to False in case local times are desired
  instead.
- #124: pyftpdlib now accepts command line options to configure a stand alone
  anonymous FTP server when running pyftpdlib with python's -m option.

  define multiple 1 to 1 mappings in case you run a FTP server with
  multiple private IP addresses behind a NAT firewall with multiple
  public IP addresses.
- #128: files and directories owner and group names and os.readlink are now
  resolved via AbstractedFS methods instead of in format_list().

- #131: pyftpdlib is now able to serve both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time by
  using a single socket.
- #133: AbstractedFS constructor now accepts two argumets: root and cmd_channel
  breaking compatibility with previous version.  Also, root and and cwd
  attributes became properties.  The previous bug consisting in resetting
  the root from the ftp handler after user login has been fixed to ease
  the development of subclasses.
- #134: enabled TCP_NODELAY socket option for the FTP command channels
  resulting in pyftpdlib being twice faster.
- #135: Python 2.3 support has been dropped.
- #137: added new pyftpdlib.contrib.filesystems module within
  UnixFilesystem class which permits the client to escape its home
  directory and navigate the real filesystem.
- #138: added DTPHandler.get_elapsed_time() method which returns the transfer
  elapsed time in seconds.
- #144: a "username" parameter is now passed to authorizer's

       - on_logout()
       - log_cmd()
       - log_transfer()
    - proto_cmds class attribute has been added.  The FTPHandler class no
       longer relies on "ftpserver.proto_cmds" global dictionary but on
       "ftpserver.FTPHandler.proto_cmds" instead.

  dealing with ill-behaved clients on OS X . (reported by Wentao Han)
- #105: ECONNABORTED might be thrown by socket.accept() on FreeBSD causing the
  server to crash.
- #109: an unhandled EBADF exception might be thrown when using poll() on OSX
  and FreeBSD.
- #111: the license used was not MIT as stated in source files.
- #112: fixed a MDTM related test case failure occurring on 64 bit OSes.
- #113: fixed unix_ftp.py which was treating anonymous as a normal user.
- #114: MLST is now denied unless the "l" permission has been specified for the
  user.
- #115: asyncore.dispatcher.close() is now called before doing any other
  cleanup operation when client disconnects. This way we avoid an endless
  loop which hangs the server in case an exception is raised in close()
  method. (thanks Arkadiusz Wahlig)
- #116: extra carriage returns were added to files transferred in ASCII mode.
- #118: CDUP always changes to "/".
