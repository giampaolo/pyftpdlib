'''A unix FTP daemon. This daemon has the ability to:

 - Spawn multiple worker processes (ala pre-fork).
 - Drop privileges after privileged operations.
 - Close gracefully when signaled.

    #                FTPHandler.
    # addr - The IP address to bind to.
    # port - The TCP port to bind to.
    # worker_num - The number of workers is useful if you are running on an
    #              SMP system. This will allow a worker process on each CPU
    #              rather than only CPU0.
